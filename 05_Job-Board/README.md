📌 Job Board Web Application (MERN Stack)

This project is a full-stack Job Board web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
The main goal of this project is to provide a platform where employers can post job openings and candidates can search and apply for jobs in an easy and secure way.

The application supports role-based access, meaning employers and candidates have separate dashboards and features according to their roles.
